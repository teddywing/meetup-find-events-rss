You'll get the chance to see what others are working on, share your projects, and to get inspiration and feedback from fellow tinkerers.</p> <p>On any given Tuesday night you have people working on electronics, knitting, writing code, wood-working, or just their plans for world domination. Beer is also consumed.</p> <p>We’ll provide: space to work, basic tools, power, a room full of like minded people.</p> <p>You’ll provide: your project, ideas and beer (optional). A laptop would probably be useful too.</p> <p>Sometimes we work on group projects together, which are usually set up as separate meetup events. Keep an eye on our events page to see what we’re working on next.</p> <p>Note: We usually have around 10 or 20 people at these events, many of our members come along but aren't counted as they don't respond on meetup.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/3/b/2/600_459406002.jpeg\" /></p> ",

On March 14th, Yottaa detected an outage of the google ad service, which outage lasted for 3 hours and caused response times of websites to be 30 seconds. 3rd Parties don't need a major outage to have an impact. Everyone has ignored the CatchPoint sample that is 10+ seconds because of a 3rd party.</p> <p>Working with hundreds of large websites; Yottaa has seen the effects of using 3rd parties and how sites should handle them. We'll talk performance data and waterfalls that show the effects of third parties and techniques sites can use to mitigate the impact of performance problems, outages, ad blockers.

Government organizations such as NIST have come out with guidelines for Application Container Security. How can you demonstrate to your security department that you truly embrace DevSecOps?</p> <p>Bring your laptop – bring your images - we will use Aqua’s Open Source tool to go “hands-on” and scan Docker images and discuss the results as a group. The goal of the exercise would be to empower developers to have more enlightened conversations with their security counterparts, by providing strong insights into potential vulnerabilities and how to take corrective actions right within the CI/CD pipeline.</p> <p>About Our Speaker:</p> <p>Tsvi Korren, CISSP, has been an enterprise IT professional for 20 years, with background in business process consulting in large organizations. Tsvi is currently the Chief Solutions Architect at Aqua, concentrating on building bridges between DevOps and Security.</p> <p>Second Presenter tbc-- stay tuned!</p> <p>Thank you to our event space host, food and beverage sponsor, and presenter Aqua Security Software!</p> <p>If you'd like to host, sponsor, or present at our next Docker meetup, ping Jonas, Chris, and/or Michelle!</p> <p>Please also let us know if you'd like to give a lightning talk.</p> ",

            "description": "<p>The Boston FinTech community has long been interested in new trends and takeaways from the current state of Venture Capital, from raising the first round of seed capital to an overall exit strategy. We are thrilled to bring a panel together who have experienced this path firsthand;</p> <p>- Adam Broun, COO Kensho<br/>- David Jegen, Managing Partner F Prime Capital<br/>- Hal Berliner, EY IPO Partner</p> <p>Expertly moderated by Jeff Galin at EY, this will be an actionable discussion. We know that though some startups successfully bootstrap, the majority of us need funding to move from idea stage and through the various stages of growth. The good news is that the interest in FinTech start-ups remains incredibly high. Silicon Valley Bank’s 2018 State of the Markets research found that the average seed round (for all start-ups) has increased from $600k in 2009 to $2.3m in 2017 with little impact on the average founder dilution.</p> <p>The bad news is that the bar for securing investment capital remains incredibly high. Please join us for an evening discussion on when and how to raise capital and tackle the challenges of the growth and IPO/liquidity event stages from the perspectives of entrepreneurs, institutional investors and venture capitalists.</p> <p>We’re looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>Please note if you are on the waitlist for this meet-up or in another city, we have heard your request and are working on livestreaming the panel. Please watch this space for more information on if and where we will broadcast!</p> ",
